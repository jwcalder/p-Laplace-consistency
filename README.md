# p-Laplace-consistency

This repository includes scripts to reproduce the consistency simulation results for p-Laplace learning from the paper below. The two main scripts are `sbm.py`, which reproduces the stochastic block model results, and `image.py` which reproduces the image classification results with MNIST and Cifar-10 data sets. Install the required packages in `requirements.txt` first.
